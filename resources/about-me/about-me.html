                <img src="../images/coding.jpg" alt="coding">
                <p>I've only begun serious coding within the past few months, but am very focused on improving my skills.  I had coded during college, but my day to day job didn't really require it as much and I found myself coding less.  During the pandemic, I had picked it up again and have begun taking it more seriously.</p>

                <h3>Fitness</h3>
                <img src="../images/gym.jpg" alt="fitness weights">
                <p>Fitness has been a big part of my life as I try to pride myself on living a healthy life style. I've been into fitness and working out since high school and have actively continued through my life. I have a 6-day workout split that I try to adhere to every weak in order to maintain my current weight and strength.</p>

                <h3>Day Trading and Investing</h3>
                <img src="../images/investing.jpg" alt="stock market chart"
                <p>Investing and Finance has always been interesting to me ever since my father introduced me to the Stock Market in elementary school. We also had a game that we would play in 5th Grade to see who's investments would make the most money after a month when given $500 to spend. I manage my own portfolio as well as do a little options trading on the side. My interest in finance was one of the reasons I minored in Economics.</p>

                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                <img src="../images/gaming.jpg" alt="gaming image">
                <p>Gaming has a bad connotation where a lot of people perceive it as a waste of time. I enjoy playing puzzle/strategy games with my friends as it allows us all to connect as we don't live too close. During the Covid pandemic lockdown, where interacting with friends was difficult, Zoom and online games made it easy to continue to spend time with friends and family.</p>
